# Password Checker App


This is a password checker app. It SHA1-hashes the password you enter using the [Hashify API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/3362843/RWMCt9WU), and sends it to the [Enzoic API](https://www.enzoic.com/docs-passwords-api/) to see if it's included on a list of commonly exposed passwords. 

## How Does It Work?

This is a Next.js app that uses a form and Next.js API  to submit information to a GraphQL API.
